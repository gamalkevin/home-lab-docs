# Homelab Creation Documentation

I will be documenting future activities about learning to build a homelab *here*.
Keep in mind that I am an absolute beginner at this, so expect imperfections and mistakes here and there.

With that said, I'm confident on my ability to learn and adapt. This might not be easy, but it is totally doable. 
Bismillah.
