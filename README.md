# Home Lab Project Documentation
*By: Gamal Kevin A.*

This repository will serve as a documentation hub for my personal Home Lab learning & creation journey. 
Keep in mind that I am an absolute beginner at this, so expect imperfections and mistakes here and there.

I will be utilizing LLMs such as OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) for troubleshooting and to help me better understand command outputs.

With that said, I'm confident on my ability to learn and adapt. This might not be easy, but it is totally doable. 
Bismillah.

The whole documentation will utilize [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for ease of use, readability, and structure.

For planned activities, see the [Codex](https://github.com/gamalkevin/home-lab-docs/blob/main/README.md).
